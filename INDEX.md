## 🎯 How to Use This Package

### **For PM Roles at Tech Companies**

**Priority order:**
1. Read CASE_STUDY.md (understand the story)
2. Run demo.py (see it in action)
3. Upload to GitHub (show code literacy)
4. Add to portfolio site (online presence)
5. Update resume (featured project)

**Resume bullet point:**
```
• Built RedHood Insights, an AI-powered market intelligence platform 
  that aggregates 50+ feeds and uses LLMs to extract actionable 
  narratives, reducing trader research time by 83% (validated with 
  50 user surveys and 5 beta testers)
```

---

### **For PM Roles at Finance/Trading Companies**

**Priority order:**
1. Emphasize domain expertise (you understand trading workflows)
2. Highlight market research (TAM/SAM/SOM for fintech)
3. Show technical depth (AI integration, API handling)
4. Demo live if possible (authentic user)

**Key talking point:**
"I built this because I experienced the pain point firsthand as a trader. The 'entropy risk' framework came from my physics background - it's a way to quantify market uncertainty that resonates with technical traders."

---

### **For Technical PM Roles**

**Priority order:**
1. Lead with the code (redhood_aggregator.py)
2. Discuss technical architecture decisions
3. Show prompt engineering expertise (AI is hot right now)
4. Highlight system design thinking

**Interview prep:**
- Be ready to explain: "Why Python over Node.js?"
- Be ready to discuss: "How would you scale this to 10K users?"
- Be ready to answer: "What's your prompt engineering process?"

---

### **For Consumer Product Roles**

**Priority order:**
1. User research emphasis (50 surveys, 5 interviews)
2. Persona development ("Active Alex")
3. Pricing strategy ($49/mo validated with 66% WTP)
4. GTM plan (Product Hunt, content marketing)

**Key framing:**
"This is a B2C product with prosumer positioning - like Spotify or Notion. The key insight is that 'free' (manual aggregation) has a hidden cost (3 hours daily), so we can charge for time savings."
