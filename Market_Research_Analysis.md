## 📊 Executive Summary

**Market Opportunity:**  
The retail trading intelligence market is growing rapidly with 15M+ active retail traders in the US alone. Current solutions are either too expensive (Bloomberg Terminal at $24K/year), too noisy (social platforms), or non-existent (manual aggregation). RedHood Insights targets the underserved segment of serious retail traders who need institutional-quality insights at consumer prices.

**Key Findings:**
- **TAM:** $7.5B (15M traders × $500/year average spend on tools)
- **SAM:** $1B (2M "serious" traders willing to pay for intelligence)
- **SOM (Year 1):** $5M (10K traders × $49/month)
- **Market Gap:** No existing solution combines multi-source aggregation + AI analysis + trade journaling in one platform
- **Competitive Moat:** LLM-native architecture, "entropy risk" framework (physics-based differentiation)
